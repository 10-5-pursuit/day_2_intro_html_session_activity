# Environmental Awareness Project - Student Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Environmental Awareness Project! This project aims to educate students on the importance of environmental conservation through a hands-on web development experience. You will create a website consisting of several pages, each dedicated to different environmental conservation topics such as water conservation, recycling and waste management, and renewable energy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
- A GitHub account.
- Git installed on your computer.
- A text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, Atom).

### Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**: Navigate to the GitHub repository provided by your instructor. Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   git clone <URL_OF_YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY>
   ```

   Replace `<URL_OF_YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY>` with the actual URL of your forked repository.

3. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd environmental-awareness-project
   ```

## Project Structure

Your project should include the following files:

- `main.html`: The main page that serves as the entry point to the other topics.
- `challenge1.html`: A page dedicated to water conservation.
- `challenge2.html`: A page focusing on recycling and waste management.
- `challenge3.html`: A page that explores renewable energy.

## Development

1. **Create the Main Page**: Start by editing `main.html` to introduce the website and link to the three challenges.

2. **Develop Challenge Pages**: For each challenge (`challenge1.html`, `challenge2.html`, `challenge3.html`), create content that educates users on the topic. Include text, images, and links back to the main page.

3. **Test Your Website**: Open your HTML files in a web browser to test the layout, links, and content.

## Contribution

1. **Commit Changes**: As you complete each section of your project, commit your changes using Git. Use meaningful commit messages to describe the changes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
   ```

2. **Push Changes to GitHub**: Once you've made progress or completed the project, push your changes to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Submit Your Work**: Submit your PR link to Canvas
