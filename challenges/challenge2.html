    <h2>Understanding Recycling Processes</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            Recycling transforms waste materials into new products, reducing the need for virgin recources and
            minimizing environmental impact. It involves collecting, sorting, and processing materials such as paper,
            glass, plastic, and metals. By recycling, we can conserve natural resources, save energy, and reduce
            pollution.

        <p>
            Effective waste management goes beyond recycling. It includes reducing the amount og waste generated,
            reusing items whenever possiblem and disposing of water responsibly. Composting organic waste, avoiding
            single-use plastics, and supporting products made from recycled matreials are key steps toward
            sustainable waste management.
