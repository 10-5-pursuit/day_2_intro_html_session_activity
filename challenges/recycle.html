        <h2>Understanding Recycling Processes</h2>
        <p>Recycling transforms waste materials into new products, reducing the need for virgin resources and minimizing environmental impact. <br> It involves collecting, sorting, and processing materials such as paper, glass, plastic, and metals. <br> By recycling, we can conserve natural resources, save energy, and reduce pollution.</p>

        <h2>Effective Waste Management Practices</h2>
        <p>Effective waste management goes <strong>beyond</strong> recycling.  It includes reducing the amount of waste generated, reusing items whenever possible, and disposing of waste responsibly. <br> Composting organic waste, avoiding single-use plastics, and supporting products made from recycled materials are key steps toward sustainable waste management.</p>
